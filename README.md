# Rotary Inverted Pendulum
## Overview
This repository serves as an archive of documentation and code for modelling, simulating and controlling a rotary inverted pendulum I built to learn more about control techniques. The focus is on applying multiple control implementations for educational purposes.

## Contents
üìñ **Documentation** - How to Assemble, Hardware Requirements, Useful Links. \
‚öôÔ∏è **Control Implementations** - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). \
üñ•Ô∏è **Code** - Mathematical Model, Simulation, Control Implementation on Arduino Uno.

## Usage 
This repository is intended as a reference for anyone interested in control systems and the rotary inverted pendulum. While it is not actively maintained, all code and documentation are provided to be used as you wish.
