# Rotary Inverted Pendulum
## Overview
This repository serves as an archive of documentation and code for modelling, simulating and controlling a rotary inverted pendulum that I built to learn more about control techniques. The focus is on applying multiple control implementations for educational purposes. While it is not actively maintained, all code and documentation are provided to be used as you wish.

## Contents
üìñ **Documentation** - How to Assemble, Hardware Requirements, Useful Links. \
‚öôÔ∏è **Control Implementations** - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). \
üñ•Ô∏è **Code** - Mathematical Model, Simulation, Control Implementation on Arduino Uno.

## Usage 
The repository is structured into two folders:
- [hardware](hardware)
- [software](software)

The ```hardware``` folder contains datasheets, source links and assembly instructions for the mechanical parts used to build the rotary inverted pendulum. This includes the microcontroller, stepper motor and assembly of the electronics. The ```software``` folder contains code to model, simulate and control the rotary inverted pendulum.
